# Crustabri_ipafair

Crustabri_ipafair provides an IPAFAIR-compatible library built upon the Crustabri solver.

Compiling the project produces the library `libcrustabri_ipafair.so` in the `target/release` directory.
The `python/crustabri.py` directory contains an example of Python class taking advantage of this library to provide an IPAFAIR-compatible dynamic AF solver.
